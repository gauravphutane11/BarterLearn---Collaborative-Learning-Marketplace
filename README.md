- 🎥 Simulated video chat environment (ready for WebRTC integration)
- 📊 Real-time progress tracking and session management
- 💬 In-session chat functionality
- ⭐ User ratings and review system
- 📈 Personal learning statistics dashboard

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/barterlearn.git
   cd barterlearn
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv             # create virtual environment
   venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   flask db init                   # initialize migrations
   flask db migrate -m "initial"
   flask db upgrade   # optionally populate sample users
   python seed.py   ```
   Create a `.env` file with at least:
   ```env
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///barterlearn.db
   ```

4. **Start both servers**
   - backend: `cd backend && flask run`
   - frontend: back in root `npm run dev`

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) and use API at `http://localhost:5000`

### Production Deployment (Waitress)

1.  **Build the Frontend**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
2.  **Setup the Backend**:
    - Ensure `backend/requirements.txt` is installed: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
    - Configure environment variables in a `.env` file in the root:
      ```env
      FLASK_ENV=production
      JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secure-secret
      DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///barterlearn.db
      CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com
      PORT=5000
      ```
3.  **Run with Waitress**:
    ```bash
    python backend/wsgi.py
    ```

The Flask server will now serve both the API (at `/api/*`) and the frontend (at `/`).

## 📱 Usage

### Logging In

## 📝 Notes for Development

### Current Implementation
This is a **prototype/demo** version with:
- Mock data for users and exchanges
- Simulated video chat interface
- Client-side only (no backend)
- Demo authentication (no real auth)

### For Production Deployment
You'll need to add:
1. **Backend API** for data persistence
2. **Database** for user and exchange data
3. **Real video chat** using WebRTC or services like Agora/Twilio
4. **Authentication system** with proper security
5. **Payment processing** if monetizing
6. **Hosting** on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS
